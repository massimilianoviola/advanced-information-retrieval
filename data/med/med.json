{"DOCID": "358", "TEXT": "1388. optic agnosia  semeiological and pathogenetic aspects the authors discuss the classical concept of agnosia and make a survey of pathogenetical factors which determine its phenomenology.  the original and traditional concept of such a term implied the loss of the capacity to recognize objects, when the functions of sense organs are undamaged.  the psychological studies on perception and the modern physiology of vision allow to avoid the dichotomy between sensation and perception and to affirm their identity.  cortex and recptors are closely bound and function in unison. every cortical alteration is thus reflected in sensorial functions; it is therefore that on practical semeiological grounds it is possible to obtain a congruous information of the corresponding cortical functionality through an exploration of sense organs carried out by suitable means.  since we are confronted with functional changes, exploration methods must be fit to evaluate dynamic aspects of perception in connection with the temporalization and spatialization of stimuli.  such methods are now quite numerous and often complex  a particular stress is laid on local adaptation, flicker fusion, and tachistoscopy on account of their significance and suitability.  by such methods it is possible to show those functional deficits or pathological disturbances of sensorial functions which are also behind the pathology of visual recognition.  fluctuation, extinction, alteration in the perception of movement, both real and apparent, changes in adaptation to light and darkness are all phenomena which can be detected instrumentally and which, at the same time, may be of determinant importance for the onset of 'agnosic' behaviour.  the complexity of the latter, on the other hand, cannot always be explained by sensorial disturbances only  other mechanisms, with a function complementary but not less indispensable to the dynamics of perceptive processes, may intervene and interfere in it.  on the basis of the latest neurophysiological data the attention is called to ocular motility and proprioceptivity, centrifugal innervation of sensorial receptors, and vestibular afferences.  a particular clinico-pathogenetical significance is attached by the authors to the association of lateral visual disturbances with altered proprioceptive and kinesthetic information from the corresponding half-body  such association in fact is nearly always present among the factors responsible for the most strictly 'spatial' errors of 'agnosic' pathology.  in the light of these pathogenetical considerations as well as of suitable semeiological findings, the authors deem it convenient to divide their cases into 3 categories with distinct clinical features  (a) cases in which altered visual behaviour may be related to changes of the visual function and of its complementary mechanisms; (b) cases in which hemianopia is associated with a homolateral deficit of somatic proprioceptivity; (c) cases in which the changes in behaviour are chiefly, but not only, due to a dissolution of the symbolic sphere."}

(2) qualitative and quantitative changes which occur in the protein of normal lenses with advancing age show a character similar to those in senile cataract, however, they are less pronounced.  in this instance, the de- crease in the quantity of soluble protein is likewise closely associated with the diminution of the protein content in the slow fractions of the electropherogram.

(b) chronic infection could readily be established by in vitro infection and no cytopathic effect was noted. (c) although many strains continued to shed virus throughout months of in vitro cultivation, no changes in growth properties occurred with the exception that infected strains from lung tissue showed limited growth capacities.  (d) from observations of over 2,000 metaphases, neither obvious chromosomal rearrangements nor non-disjunctional changes were observed in strains infected naturally or experimentally. (e) among 17 rubella abortion-derived cell strains there was a marked elevation in frequency of chromosome breakage in 3 instances (18%, 29%, 68%,).  (f) a correlation between virus shedding in vitro and increased chromosome breakage was noted although this was not complete.

(h) similarly, a slight, but significant elevation in average chromosome break frequency (9.8%) was obtained in four cell strains which had been experimentally infected in vitro with rubella virus (uninfected cells: 5.2%).  although effects upon the chromosomes were demonstrated, these were restricted to slight general elevations in frequency of breakage above normal values.  very high increases in breaks were sporadic.  it appears more likely that the general fetal abnormalities associated with rubella infection in vivo result from possible effects of the virus upon growth rather than from effects upon the chromosomes.  however, the studies were restricted to fibroblasts cultured in vitro; and effects on other types of cells may have greater implications for this question."}

(2) with fibrosis and cirrhosis (7 cases).  the liver is green, firm, with a nodular or granular surface.  the extra-hepatic biliary tree is normal.  the spleen is enlarged.  microscopy shows bile stasis, pericholangiolitic fibrosis, and proliferation of bile ductules.  the periportal, interlobular and intralobular fibrous tissue is increased, and shows cellular infiltrations. the architecture of the liver is disturbed by the presence of pseudolobuli in the regeneration areas.  it is suggested that these cases are due to a congenital viral hepatitis, which is not only the result of an intrauterine infection, but also a feature of fetal hepatitis, with secondary pericholangiolitic or post-necrotic liver cirrhosis. the neonatal giant cell hepatitis is to be considered as the result of a cytotoxic action of the virus.  the author considers also the possibility of a viral etiology in cases of biliary atresia on the basis of their morphological similarity with congenital viral hepatitis."}
